15-112 Term Project S17 (Bharath Prabhu) - FIFA 17 Training Game --> tkinter (Python)

My term project is a football game like FIFA 17, but instead of playing soccer matches, the user trains
players in attacking play based on these 2 ideas:

- possession based football
- one touch passing

There are 3 levels of gameplay in this game. The goal of the user is to score a goal in each level while
meeting minimum and maximum passing requirements and not lose possession of the ball as well. The
computer defender will get increasingly more intelligent for each subsequent level. Therefore, the user 
should use tactics or methods developed from previous rounds and improvise in order to beat a more
clever defender.

There are hints provided at each level to assist the user on how to tackle that level of the game if he 
or she is struggling with it. At the end of the game, there is also a player statistics page that shows
the user number of interceptions made by the defender as well as passing accuracy of his players and 
the user can try out different ways of playing to improve those statistics.
