**FIFA Training Game**

This is a term project built for a programming class at CMU. This training game has 3 levels (each more difficult than the previous) where the player (you) will have to score a goal within a limited number of passes set in the game.

The training game is built on an MVC architecture in Python. There is some simple artificial intelligence in the game where the computer player moves position based on your passes.
